This file documents deprecated parts of the Mutagen API. New code
should not use these parts, and several months after being added here,
they may be removed. Note that we do not intend to ever deprecate or
remove large portions of the API. All of these are corner cases that
arose from when Mutagen was still part of Quod Libet, and should never
be encountered in normal use.

General:
--------
FileType constructors require a filename. However, the 'delete' and
'save' methods should not be called with one.

No modules, types, functions, or attributes beginning with '_' are
considered public API. These can and do change drastically between
Mutagen versions. This is the standard Python way of marking a
function protected or private.

FLAC:
-----
The 'vc' attribute predates the FileType API and has been deprecated
since Mutagen 0.9; this also applies to the 'add_vc' method. The
standard 'tags' attribute and 'add_tags' method should be used
instead.

ID3:
----
The 'fullread', 'load_header', 'read_frames', 'load_framedata', and
'save_frame' methods of ID3 are not intended to be public APIs. They
will change or disappear in the future.

None of the Spec objects are considered part of the public API.
