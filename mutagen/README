Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata. It supports
reading ID3 (all versions), APEv2, FLAC, and Ogg
Vorbis/FLAC/Theora/Speex.  It can write ID3v1.1, ID3v2.4, APEv2, FLAC,
and Ogg Vorbis/FLAC/Theora/Speex comments. It can also read MPEG audio
and Xing headers, FLAC stream info blocks, WavPack headers, and Ogg
Vorbis/FLAC/Theora/Speex stream headers. Finally, it includes a module
to handle generic Ogg bitstreams.

Installing
----------
 $ ./setup.py build
 $ su -c "./setup.py install"

Documentation
-------------
The primary documentation for Mutagen is the doc strings found in
the source code.
 $ pydoc mutagen
 $ pydoc mutagen.<module>

The tools/ directory contains several useful examples, and there is a
brief tutorial in TUTORIAL.

Testing the Module
------------------
To test Mutagen's MP3 reading support, run
 $ tools/mutagen-pony <your top-level MP3 directory here>
Mutagen will try to load all of them, and report any errors.

To look at the tags in files, run
 $ tools/mutagen-inspect filename ...

To run our test suite,
 $ ./setup.py test

If you install pyvorbis, eyeD3, flac, and ogginfo, compatibility tests
will be run (if not a warning will be printed).

If you're using Python 2.4.2 the tests will fail. This is due to a
file descriptor leak present in that version of Python. 2.4.1 and
earlier and 2.4.3 and later work correctly.

Compatibility
-------------
As we write ID3v2.4 tags, id3lib cannot read them. However, if you enable
ID3v1 tag saving (pass v1=2 to ID3.save), id3lib will read that.

iTunes has a bug in its handling of very large ID3v2.4 tags (such as
tags that contain an attached picture). Mutagen will be able to read
frames from iTunes, but iTunes may not be able to read the frames
written by Quod Libet. Removing the APIC (or other large) tag will
solve this.
