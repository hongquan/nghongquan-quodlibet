.SH OPTIONS
Ex Falso may be given a directory to open on the command line.
.SH TIED TAGS
Many places in Ex Falso allow you to use "tied tags". Tied tags are two tag
names joined together with a "~" like "title~version" or "album~part".
Tied tags result in "nice" displays even when one of the tags is missing;
for example, "title~version" will result in \fITitle\ \-\ Version\fR when
a version tag is present, but only \fITitle\fR when one isn't. You can
tie any number of tags together.
.SH RENAMING FILES
Ex Falso allows you to rename files based on their tags. In some
cases you may wish to alter the filename depending on whether some
tags are present or missing, in addition to their values. A common
pattern might be
.RS 4
<tracknumber>. <title~version>
.RE
You can use a '|' to only text when a tag is present:
.RS 4
<tracknumber|<tracknumber>. ><title~version>
.RE
You can also specify literal text to use if the tag is missing by adding
another '|':
.RS 4
<album|<album>|No Album> \- <title>
.RE
