Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata. It supports FLAC,
M4A, MP3, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True Audio, and
WavPack audio files. All versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all
standard ID3v2.4 frames are parsed. It can read Xing headers to
accurately calculate the bitrate and length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2
tags can be edited regardless of audio format. It can also manipulate
Ogg streams on an individual packet/page level.

Installing
----------
 $ ./setup.py build
 $ su -c "./setup.py install"

Documentation
-------------
The primary documentation for Mutagen is the doc strings found in
the source code.
 $ pydoc mutagen
 $ pydoc mutagen.<module>

The tools/ directory contains several useful examples, and there is a
brief tutorial in TUTORIAL.

Testing the Module
------------------
To test Mutagen's MP3 reading support, run
 $ tools/mutagen-pony <your top-level MP3 directory here>
Mutagen will try to load all of them, and report any errors.

To look at the tags in files, run
 $ tools/mutagen-inspect filename ...

To run our test suite,
 $ ./setup.py test

Compatibility
-------------
Mutagen writes ID3v2.4 tags which id3lib cannot read. If you enable
ID3v1 tag saving (pass v1=2 to ID3.save), id3lib will read those.

iTunes has a bug in its handling of very large ID3 tags (such as tags
that contain an attached picture). Mutagen can read tags from iTunes,
but iTunes may not be able to read tags written by Quod Libet.
