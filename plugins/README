Plugins for Quod Libet and Ex Falso
===================================

This is the set of plugins maintained by the Quod Libet project, designed for
use with Quod Libet and Ex Falso.

It is recommended that users install both the applications and the plugins from
their distribution's package manager if possible. Those running the latest
version from the project's Mercurial repository should use the plugins from the
same revision. If you are installing Quod Libet and Ex Falso from source, you
may use these plugins by copying the contents of this folder to
~/.quodlibet/plugins/ with the directory structure intact.

Some plugins require additional dependencies to work properly. These missing
dependencies are reported from within the application's plugin screen.
