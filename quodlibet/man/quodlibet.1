.SH ALBUM COVERS
Album covers should be put in the same directory as the songs they
apply to, and have "folder", "front", or "cover" in their filenames.
If you want to store multiple albums in the same directory but keep
distinct cover images, the name of the appropriate image file must
contain the \fBlabelid\fI tag value, e.g. \fICOCX\-32760 cover.jpg\fR.
.SH TIED TAGS
Many places in Quod Libet allow you to use "tied tags". Tied tags are two tag
names joined together with a "~" like "title~version" or "album~part".
Tied tags result in "nice" displays even when one of the tags is missing;
for example, "title~version" will result in \fITitle\ \-\ Version\fR when
a version tag is present, but only \fITitle\fR when one isn't. You can
tie any number of tags together.
.SH SEARCH SYNTAX
All of Quod Libet's search boxes support advanced searches of the
following forms:
.RS 4
tag = value
.br
tag = !value
.br
tag = "value"
.br
tag = /value/
.br
tag = &(value1, value2)
.br
tag = |(value1, value2)
.br
!tag = value
.br
|(tag1 = value1, tag2 = value2)
.br
&(tag1 = value1, tag2 = value2)
.br
#(numerictag < value)
.br
#(numerictag = value)
.br
#(numerictag > value)
.RE
The '\fBc\fR' postfix on strings or regular expressions makes the search
case-sensitive. Numeric values may be given as integers, floating-point
numbers, MM:SS format, or simple English, e.g. "3 days", "2 hours".
.PP
See http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/wiki/Guide_Searching.
.PP
All internal tags begin with a ~ character. Non-numeric internal tags
are ~basename, ~dirname, ~filename, ~format, ~length, ~people, and ~rating.
Numeric internal tags are ~#added, ~#bitrate, ~#disc, ~#lastplayed,
~#laststarted, ~#length, ~#mtime, ~#playcount, ~#skipcount, and ~#track.
.PP
See http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/wiki/Guide_InternalTags.
.SH RENAMING FILES
Quod Libet allows you to rename files based on their tags. In some
cases you may wish to alter the filename depending on whether some
tags are present or missing, in addition to their values. A common
pattern might be
.RS 4
<tracknumber>. <title~version>
.RE
You can use a '|' to only text when a tag is present:
.RS 4
<tracknumber|<tracknumber>. ><title~version>
.RE
You can also specify literal text to use if the tag is missing by adding
another '|':
.RS 4
<album|<album>|No Album> \- <title>
.RE
See http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/wiki/Guide_Renaming.
.SH AUDIO BACKENDS
Quod Libet uses GStreamer for audio playback. It tries to read your GConf
GStreamer configuration, but if that fails it falls back to osssink. You
can change the \fBpipeline\fR option in \fI~/.quodlibet/config\fR to use
a different sink, or pass options to the sink. For example, you might use
\fBesdsink\fR or \fBalsasink device=hw:1\fR.
.PP
See http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/wiki/Guide_AudioBackends.
.SH FILES

all songs from your library.
.IP \fI~/.quodlibet/config\fR 4

exits.
.IP \fI~/.quodlibet/current\fR 4
A "key=value" file containing information about the currently playing song.
.IP \fI~/.quodlibet/control\fR 4
A FIFO connected to the most-recently-started instance of the program.
