Ex Falso / Quod Libet - A Music Library/Editor/Player
========================================================================
Quod Libet is a music management program. It provides several different ways
to view your audio library, as well as support for Internet radio and
audio feeds. It has extremely flexible metadata tag editing and searching
capabilities.

Ex Falso is a tag editor with the same tag editing interface as Quod Libet,
but it does not play files.

Supported file formats include Ogg Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, MOD/XM/IT, Musepack,
Wavpack, and MPEG-4 AAC.
