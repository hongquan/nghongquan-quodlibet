This file documents deprecated parts of the Imagen API. New code
should not use these parts, and several months after being added here,
they may be removed. Note that we do not intend to ever deprecate or
remove large portions of the API after the first release.

General:
--------
No modules, types, functions, or attributes beginning with '_' are
considered public API. These can and do change drastically between
Mutagen versions. This is the standard Python way of marking a
function protected or private.

Imagen's goal is to adhere as closely as possible to published
specifications. If you try to abuse Mutagen to make it write things in
a non-standard fashion, Joe will update Imagen to break your
program. If you want to do nonstandard things, write your own broken
library.
