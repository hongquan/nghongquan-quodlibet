The Roadmap
===========

In Brief
--------

**Python 3 support:**

    No plans. First all dependencies (like mutagen) have to be ported.
    At the moment python 2 does its job and there is no real reason to change.

Overview
--------

Quod Libet (including Ex Falso) is a mature, stable project. It also, 
however, has an active community helping develop, test, and translate new 
features and issues and build new plugins.

Having a product roadmap helps collect, define and plan future development 
amongst disparate, part-time contributors better than ad-hoc discussions or 
email chains. For packagers and maintainers, it allows easier 
synchronisation with their downstream schedules (eg Ubuntu/Fedora's 6-month 
cycle)

For the many, and ever-increasing number of users, it allows seeing and 
even previewing upcoming features and overhauls, and thus encourage 
increased ownership of the project.

Release Cycle
-------------

QL has no official release cycle; instead releases are made when they (and 
maintainer(s)!) are ready. Binaries are built at the end of this process.

Power users are of course encouraged to check out the latest code from 
mercurial and build themselves but it comes with even fewer guaranties than 
normal.
