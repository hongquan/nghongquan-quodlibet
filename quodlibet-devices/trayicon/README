Notification area icon as a PyGTK object
----------------------------------------
This module lets you put a simple icon in a FreeDesktop.org-compatible
notification area, and receive the 'activate' event when the left button
is pressed, and 'popup-menu' when the right button is pressed.

This code was ripped from libegg CVS, and so when it breaks you get
both pieces.

Compiling:
----------
(Requires the PyGTK and Python development libraries.)
$ make statusicon.so

Usage:
------
import statusicon
picture = gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_file_at_size("icon.png", 16, 16)
icon = statusicon.StatusIcon(picture)
icon.connect("activate", toggle_hideshow)
icon.set_tooltip("Click to hide or show the main window", "magic")

Currently only the pixbuf-based constructor is exposed to Python,
and set_tooltip still requires its second argument which I don't
actually understand. :) Patches for further functionality
appreciated, but I only implemented what I needed.
