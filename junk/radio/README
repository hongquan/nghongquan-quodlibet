A bunch of scripts for retrieving internet radio stream URLs and their metadata

 - crawer_*.py: Add new URIs to uris.txt
 - clean_uris.py: cleans up the list
 - update_taglist.py: creates the final radiolist file

HOWTO
-----

 - crawler_sky_di_fm.py
 - crawler_google.py (takes some hours)
 - clean_uris.py
    Use the google dns for good results: 8.8.8.8
 - update_taglist.py
    Call it on two different days, at different times, because
    some stations are not online all the time.
    Always delete the uris_failed.txt after a complete run.
