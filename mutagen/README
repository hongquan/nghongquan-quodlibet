Mutagen is an audio metadata tag reader and writer implemented in pure
Python. It supports reading ID3v1.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, ID3v2.4, APEv2,
Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC, and writing ID3v1.1, ID3v2.4, APEv2, Ogg Vorbis,
and FLAC. It can also read MPEG audio and Xing headers, FLAC stream
info blocks, and Ogg Vorbis identification headers.

Installing
----------
 $ ./setup.py build
 $ su -c "./setup.py install"

Documentation
-------------
The primary documentation for Mutagen is the doc strings found in
the source code.
 $ pydoc mutagen
 $ pydoc mutagen.<module>

The tools/ directory contains several useful examples, and there is a
brief tutorial in TUTORIAL.

Testing the Module
------------------
To test Mutagen's MP3 reading support, run
 $ tools/mutagen-pony <your top-level MP3 directory here>
Mutagen will try to load all of them, and report any errors.

To look at the tags in files, run
 $ tools/mutagen-inspect filename ...

To run our test suite,
 $ ./_sanity.sh

If you install pyvorbis and/or eyeD3, compatibility tests will be run.

Compatibility
-------------
As we write ID3v2.4 tags, id3lib cannot read them. However, if you enable
ID3v1 tag saving (pass v1=2 to ID3.save), id3lib will read that.
