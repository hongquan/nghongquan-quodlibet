mutagen.id3 needs:
 * Detect tags in non-beginning locations, particularly if multiple
   separate version tags exist at the beginning of the file
 * Perhaps implement tag merging - "intelligently" merge information
   from all known tag formats
 * Some test cleanup

mutagen.apev2 needs:
 * General cleanup to fit the basic structure of the rest of Mutagen.
